# B1: Problem Statement â€” Find the Average

You can calculate the average of a set of numbers using the formula:

**Formula:**

Average = (sum of all numbers) / (count of numbers)

**Example:**

sum = 5 + 8 + 12 + 4 + 10 = 39  
Average = 39 / 5 = 7.8

## B2: Pseudocode

```text
sum = 0
count = 0

FOR each value IN numbers DO
    sum = sum + value
    count = count + 1
END FOR

IF count = 0 THEN
    print "This list is empty, unable to take average."
ELSE
    average = sum / count
    print average
END IF
```

## B3: BNF for [list] of Numbers (Positive Only)

```bnf
<list> ::= "[" <elements> "]"
<elements> ::= <number> | <number> "," <elements>
<number> ::= <digit> | <digit> <number>
<digit> ::= "0" | ... | "9"
```

## B4: Parse Tree for Example Input

```text
<list>
    "["
    <elements>
        <number>
            <digit>
                "5"
    ","
    <elements>
        <number>
            <digit>
                "8"
    ","
    <elements>
        <number>
            <digit>
                "1"
        <number>
            <digit>
                "2"
    ","
    <elements>
        <number>
            <digit>
                "4"
    ","
    <elements>
        <number>
            <digit>
                "1"
        <number>
            <digit>
                "0"
    "]"
```
## B5: Is the grammar ambiguous 
```text
The grammar of the parse tree is unambiguous because each input is clearly defined.
Commas separate the elements, and multi-digit numbers like 12 are clearly shown.
Ambiguity could happen if the grammar weas written differently for example,
by allowing the  <elements> ::= <elements> "," <elements>.
In that case, an input like 1,2,3 could be interpreted as either (1, (2, 3)) or ((1, 2), 3).
Similarly, different interpretations might occur
if commas were grouped in different ways or if digits were split differently 

```
## B6: EBNF Form
```text
list = "["elements"]";
elements = number {"," number} ;
number = digit {digit};
digit = "0"|"1"|"2"|"3"|"4"|"5"|"6"|"7"|"8"|"9";


The benefits of using EBNF over BNF is it being more clear and easier to read compared
to BNF it also removes most abiguity by showing repetition.
There is also more flexibility when it comes to grammar 
```
## B7: EBNF Form Parse Tree
```text
<list>
    "["
    <elements>
        <number>
            <digit>
                "5"
    {"," number}
	","
        <number>
            <digit>
                "8"
    ","
        <number>
            <digit>
                "1"
            <digit>
                "2"
    ","
        <number>
            <digit>
                "4"
    ","
        <number>
            <digit>
                "1"
            <digit>
                "0"
    "]"

The BNF original grammar does not contain any ambiguity. The main syntax modifications
represented in the EBNF grammar are changing the elements assignment to better represent
repetitions of the pair "," number, the number assignment to also represent that a number
can have multiple digits, and the assignment of digit which lists out all the possible
digits in a number. These syntax modifications affect the EBNF parse tree structure by
displaying repetitions of a comma followed by a number and discarding the extra <elements>
and <number>. With these changes, the EBNF parse tree clarifies the parent and child components
such as that every <number> is under one <elements> and the amount of digits in a number is more distinct.
