# B1: Problem Statement â€” Find the Average

You can calculate the average of a set of numbers using the formula:

**Formula:**

Average = (sum of all numbers) / (count of numbers)

**Example:**

sum = 5 + 8 + 12 + 4 + 10 = 39
Average = 39 / 5 = 7.8

## B2: Pseudocode

```text
sum = 0
count = 0

FOR each value IN numbers DO
    sum = sum + value
    count = count + 1
END FOR

IF count = 0 THEN
    print "This list is empty, unable to take average."
ELSE
    average = sum / count
    print average
END IF
```

## B3: BNF for [list] of Numbers (Positive Only)

```bnf
<list>     ::= "[" <elements> "]"
<elements> ::= <number> | <number> "," <elements>
<number>   ::= <digit> | <digit> <number>
<digit>    ::= "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9"
```

```text
<list>
    "["
    <elements>
        <number>
            <digit>
                "5"
        ","
        <elements>
            <number>
                <digit>
                    "8"
            ","
            <elements>
                <number>

                <elements>
                    <number>
                        <digit>
                            "4"
                    ","
                    <elements>
                        <number>
                            <digit>
                                "1"
                            <digit>
                                "0"
    "]"
```

## B5: Is the grammar ambiguous

```text
The grammar of the parse tree is unambiguous because each input is clearly defined.
Commas separate the elements, and multi-digit numbers like 12 are clearly shown.
Ambiguity could happen if the grammar was written differently, for example,
by allowing <elements> ::= <elements> "," <elements>.
In that case, an input like 1,2,3 could be interpreted as either (1, (2, 3)) or ((1, 2), 3).
Similarly, different interpretations might occur
if commas were grouped in different ways or if digits were split differently.
```

## B6: EBNF Form

```ebnf
list     = "[" elements "]" ;
elements = number { "," number } ;
number   = digit { digit } ;
digit    = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ;
```

## B7: EBNF Form Parse Tree

```text
<list>
    "["
    <elements>
        <number>
            <digit>
                "5"
        {"," number}
            ","
            <number>
                <digit>
                    "8"
            ","
            <number>
                <digit>
                    "1"
                <digit>
                    "2"
            ","
            <number>
                <digit>
                    "4"
            ","
            <number>
                <digit>
                    "1"
                <digit>
                    "0"
    "]"
```

Compared to the BNF parse tree in B4, the EBNF tree above does not contain ambiguity.
In the BNF tree the `<elements>` list and `"," <number>` pair can appear repeatedly in a way that looks ambiguous.
The EBNF tree structure resolves this by using repetition `{ "," <number> }` instead of multiple `<elements>`.
This clarifies the child components and number of elements more directly.
It also groups multi-digit numbers correctly under a single `<number>`, making the structure clearer.
